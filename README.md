# 💫 About Me:
Currently, I am an Intern Trainee at Zoho Schools of Graduate Studies, where I focus on developing efficient backend functionalities using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS), alongside building seamless web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My technical expertise is grounded in strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms, further refined through an incubation program at Zoho.<br><br>Core Expertise & Technical Philosophy<br><br>Java & Low-Level Design (LLD): I specialize in writing clean, modular, and maintainable code by applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) principles. I focus on Low-Level Design to ensure that my software architectures are scalable and utilize design patterns that solve complex business logic efficiently.<br>+1<br><br>Web Fundamentals (Servlet API): My foundation in Java web development is rooted in the Servlet API, giving me a deep understanding of the request-response lifecycle, session management, and how the underlying web container handles concurrent traffic.<br><br>Modern Frameworks (Spring & Spring Boot): I leverage the power of Spring and Spring Boot to build robust, production-grade applications. I am particularly skilled in using Spring MVC and Spring Data JPA to streamline development and manage database interactions.<br><br>RESTful API Development: I design and implement RESTful APIs that are secure, stateless, and optimized for performance. By using Spring Boot, I create endpoints that facilitate seamless communication between diverse client-side interfaces and complex backend systems.<br><br>I am particularly passionate about Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, having developed projects such as a YOLO-based smart attendance system and LSTM-driven stock price prediction models. My commitment to technical excellence is demonstrated by my IBM AI Professional Certificate and my first-place finish in a national-level coding symposium at GCE-Salem.
